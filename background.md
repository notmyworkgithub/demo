 I am putting together a demo to show how I can vibe code an app using lovable, and then take the code from the app and use the GitHub spec kit project to extract specification details from it upon which I can use to build the application in my corporate environment.  The rationale behind this is that vibecoding is a very quick and easy way for a business person to come up with a tangible app based upon some business ideas it gives them a way to quickly iterate and flush that idea out.  The downside to this is that it may lack integrations that are needed to be compliant within a large corporation or may be missing things that are required to meet internal controls.  For this demo, we created a script (see script.md). And have already created the app based upon the script up to step 3.  I now want to showcase how I can use the github spec kit project to extract details about the application so that it can be rebuild internally.  For the purpose of this demo we're going to rebuild this application as an agent in microsoft copilot studio.  

 I need you to review how spec-kit works as well as how to create agents in copilot studio and the generate a step by step plan for me to run through to complete the demo.  Please write this as demo-plan.md

 Here are links to the spec-kit project and copilot studio documentation.
