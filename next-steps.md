# Next Steps: Building the Employee Announcement Tool

This document outlines the specific steps to build the Employee Announcement Tool based on the specifications extracted and enhanced through our spec-kit demonstration.

## ðŸ“‹ Reference Artifacts from Demo

The following artifacts were generated during our spec-kit demo and serve as the foundation for implementation:

### **Generated Specifications:**
- **`/specs/001-analyze-current/spec.md`** - Current prototype analysis and business logic
- **`/specs/002-enterprise-enhanced/spec.md`** - Enterprise-ready specifications with corporate controls
- **`/specs/002-enterprise-enhanced/plan.md`** - Technical implementation roadmap
- **`/specs/002-enterprise-enhanced/tasks.md`** - Detailed development tasks breakdown
- **`/specs/002-enterprise-enhanced/analyze.md`** - Quality and consistency validation

### **Control Documents:**
- **`corporate-controls.md`** - Non-negotiable enterprise requirements
- **`constitution.md`** - Project principles and development guidelines

### **Business Logic Preservation:**
- **Policy Update workflow** requiring Policy Name + Effective Date (verified working in prototype)
- **Dynamic form fields** based on communication type
- **Real-time preview** functionality
- **Multiple communication types** (Policy Update, Company News, Team Announcement, Benefits Update)

## ðŸš€ Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
**Goal:** Establish enterprise-ready foundation while preserving validated business logic

**Technical Approach:**
- **Platform:** SharePoint Framework (SPFx) for enterprise deployment
- **Authentication:** Microsoft Entra ID integration
- **Storage:** SharePoint Lists for announcements and audit data
- **Framework:** React (preserve existing component structure)

**Key Deliverables:**
1. **SPFx solution setup** with proper manifest and deployment configuration
2. **Entra ID authentication** integration replacing browser-only auth
3. **SharePoint data layer** replacing localStorage
4. **Core Policy Update workflow** (Policy Name + Effective Date) fully functional

**Reference Artifacts:**
- Use `/specs/002-enterprise-enhanced/spec.md` sections 1-3 for authentication requirements
- Implement tasks from `/specs/002-enterprise-enhanced/tasks.md` items 1-5

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 3-4)**
**Goal:** Rebuild all communication types with enterprise controls

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Preserve Existing React Components:**
   ```
   - AnnouncementTool.tsx (main component structure)
   - Dynamic form field generation based on communication type
   - Real-time preview functionality
   - Tone selection and formatting options
   ```

2. **Add Enterprise Data Layer:**
   ```
   SharePoint Lists:
   - Announcements (Title, Type, Content, Status, Creator, EffectiveDate, CreatedDate)
   - AuditLog (Action, User, Timestamp, AnnouncementId, Details)
   - ApprovalWorkflow (AnnouncementId, Approver, Status, Comments, Date)
   ```

3. **Implement Business Logic Validation:**
   - Policy Updates MUST have PolicyName and EffectiveDate
   - All other communication types follow existing field requirements
   - Client-side validation preserved, server-side validation added

**Reference Artifacts:**
- `/specs/001-analyze-current/spec.md` for original business logic preservation
- `/specs/002-enterprise-enhanced/tasks.md` items 6-12 for implementation details

### **Phase 3: Approval Workflows (Weeks 5-6)**
**Goal:** Implement management approval and audit trails

**Power Automate Flows:**
1. **Policy Update Approval Flow:**
   ```
   Trigger: New Policy Update created
   â†’ Route to management for approval
   â†’ Send Teams notification to approvers
   â†’ Update status in SharePoint
   â†’ Log approval action in audit trail
   â†’ Notify creator of decision
   ```

2. **Audit Logging Flow:**
   ```
   Trigger: Any announcement action (create, update, delete, approve)
   â†’ Capture user identity, timestamp, action details
   â†’ Store in AuditLog SharePoint list
   â†’ Ensure compliance with 7-year retention policy
   ```

**Integration Points:**
- **Microsoft Graph API** for user/manager relationships
- **Teams notifications** for approval requests
- **SharePoint REST API** for data operations
- **Power Automate HTTP actions** for custom logging

**Reference Artifacts:**
- `corporate-controls.md` sections on Approval Workflows and Audit & Compliance
- `/specs/002-enterprise-enhanced/plan.md` workflow implementation strategy

### **Phase 4: Advanced Enterprise Features (Weeks 7-8)**
**Goal:** Complete enterprise compliance and deployment readiness

**Security Implementation:**
- **Role-based access control** (Creator, Approver, Admin roles)
- **Input validation and sanitization** for all user inputs
- **HTTPS enforcement** for all data transmission
- **Rate limiting** on API endpoints

**Compliance Features:**
- **Data retention policies** (7 years for communications)
- **Legal review routing** for sensitive communications
- **Complete audit trail** with user identity and timestamps
- **Security scanning integration** in deployment pipeline

**Deployment Preparation:**
- **SPFx packaging** for SharePoint App Catalog
- **Environment configuration** (Dev, Test, Prod)
- **User training materials** and documentation
- **Performance testing** and optimization

**Reference Artifacts:**
- `corporate-controls.md` complete requirements matrix
- `/specs/002-enterprise-enhanced/analyze.md` for quality validation
