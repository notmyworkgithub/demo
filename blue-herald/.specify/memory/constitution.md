# Blue Herald Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every feature MUST prioritize clarity and ease of use for non-technical users. Form validation provides immediate, clear feedback. Visual hierarchy guides users through the announcement creation process. UI elements use intuitive icons and familiar patterns. No feature is complete until it can be used successfully by HR staff without technical training.

**Rationale**: Communication tools serve diverse users with varying technical expertise. Poor UX leads to abandoned features and communication failures.

### II. Preview-First Communication
All announcements MUST provide real-time preview with accurate formatting and styling before sending. Preview reflects exact recipient experience including tone-specific styling, badges, and layout. Changes in form inputs immediately update the preview. No announcement can be sent without preview validation.

**Rationale**: Communication errors have organizational impact. Visual confirmation prevents formatting issues and ensures intended message delivery.

### III. Contextual Intelligence
The system MUST adapt interface elements based on communication type and audience selection. Required fields appear dynamically based on announcement type. Tone suggestions align with communication context. Template assistance guides users toward appropriate messaging patterns. Field validation reflects real-world communication requirements.

**Rationale**: Different communication types have different requirements. Smart defaults and contextual guidance reduce errors and improve efficiency.

### IV. Accessibility and Inclusivity
All UI components MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Color-based information includes alternative indicators. Keyboard navigation supports all functionality. Screen reader compatibility is verified for all interactive elements. Text contrast ratios meet accessibility requirements.

**Rationale**: Communication tools must be usable by all team members regardless of abilities. Inclusive design benefits everyone.

### V. Component Consistency
All UI elements MUST use the established shadcn-ui component library with consistent styling. Custom components follow the design system patterns. Color schemes adhere to the corporate theme variables. Interactive states (hover, focus, disabled) are consistently implemented across all components.

**Rationale**: Consistent UI reduces cognitive load and creates professional, trustworthy user experience.

## Technical Standards

TypeScript MUST be used for all code with strict type checking enabled. React components follow functional patterns with proper hook usage. Tailwind CSS classes are preferred over custom CSS. Build system uses Vite for fast development and optimized production builds. All dependencies are managed through package.json with locked versions.

## Quality Assurance

Form validation prevents submission of incomplete or invalid announcements. Error messages provide clear, actionable guidance. Loading states inform users during processing. Success feedback confirms announcement delivery. User testing validates new features with actual HR personnel before release.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All pull requests MUST verify compliance with these principles. New features require UX review and accessibility validation. Breaking changes to user interface require stakeholder approval and migration plan. Component modifications must maintain backward compatibility.
