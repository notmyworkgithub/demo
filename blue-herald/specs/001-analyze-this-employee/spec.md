## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
HR administrators and team managers need to create, preview, and send professional announcements to different employee groups with appropriate tone and formatting. The system must guide users through selecting communication types, provide contextual form fields, validate required information, and show real-time preview before sending.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an HR administrator wants to send a policy update, **When** they select "Policy Update" communication type, **Then** the system displays policy name and effective date fields as required
2. **Given** a user fills out an announcement form completely, **When** they view the preview section, **Then** the preview shows the exact formatting, tone styling, and content that recipients will see
3. **Given** a user attempts to send an incomplete announcement, **When** they click send, **Then** the system prevents sending and displays specific missing field errors
4. **Given** a user selects "Urgent" tone, **When** they preview the announcement, **Then** the preview displays urgent styling with red colors, warning emoji, and uppercase title
5. **Given** a user selects "Company News" communication type, **When** the form loads contextual fields, **Then** the system auto-suggests "Friendly" tone
6. **Given** a user successfully sends an announcement, **When** the send action completes, **Then** the form resets to blank state and shows success confirmation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user selects a communication type but doesn't fill required contextual fields?
- How does the system handle invalid date formats in deadline fields?
- What occurs if a user changes communication type after filling contextual fields?
- How does the preview update when users modify tone selection mid-creation?
