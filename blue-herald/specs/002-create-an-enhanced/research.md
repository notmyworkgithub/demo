# Research: Enterprise Employee Announcement Tool

## Microsoft 365 Integration Research

### Decision: Microsoft Graph API + SharePoint Framework (SPFx)
**Rationale**: Microsoft Graph provides unified API access to SharePoint, Teams, and Azure AD. SPFx allows deep integration with SharePoint and Teams while maintaining enterprise security controls.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Standalone web app with Graph API**: Less integrated user experience, separate deployment complexity
- **Teams-only application**: Limited to Teams context, reduced SharePoint integration
- **Custom Azure AD app**: More complex authentication flow, limited SharePoint native features

### Implementation Approach
- **Frontend**: React SPFx web part deployable to SharePoint and Teams
- **Authentication**: MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) with Azure AD integration
- **Data Storage**: SharePoint Lists for announcements, Azure SQL for audit logs
- **Approval Workflows**: Microsoft Power Automate for workflow orchestration

## Authentication Architecture Research

### Decision: MSAL React with Role-Based Access Control
**Rationale**: MSAL provides seamless Azure AD integration with token management. Role-based access aligns with existing enterprise security models.

**Implementation Details**:
- **User Roles**: Stored in Azure AD security groups
- **Permission Management**: Custom permission service mapping AD groups to application roles
- **Token Handling**: MSAL handles token refresh and secure storage
- **Session Management**: Browser session with automatic renewal

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Custom authentication**: Increased security risk, duplicate effort
- **Third-party identity provider**: Additional integration complexity

## Data Architecture Research

### Decision: Hybrid SharePoint + Azure SQL Architecture
**Rationale**: SharePoint Lists for business data leverages existing permissions and collaboration features. Azure SQL for audit logs provides performance and compliance capabilities.

**Data Model**:
- **Announcements**: SharePoint List with custom content types
- **Approval Workflows**: SharePoint workflow lists with Power Automate integration
- **Audit Logs**: Azure SQL database with compliance-grade retention
- **User Profiles**: Azure AD with extended attributes in SharePoint User Profiles

**Migration Strategy**:
1. **Phase 1**: Preserve existing React components, add SharePoint backend
2. **Phase 2**: Implement approval workflows in Power Automate
3. **Phase 3**: Add audit logging with Azure SQL integration
4. **Phase 4**: Implement data retention and compliance features

## Performance and Scalability Research

### Decision: Progressive Web App (PWA) with Caching Strategy
**Rationale**: PWA provides native-like experience while maintaining web deployment simplicity. Caching reduces SharePoint API calls and improves performance.

**Performance Optimizations**:
- **Component Lazy Loading**: Load approval components only for managers
- **SharePoint List Caching**: Cache announcement templates and user roles
- **Microsoft Graph Batching**: Batch API calls for better performance
- **CDN Integration**: Leverage SharePoint CDN for static assets

## Security Research

### Decision: Zero Trust Security Model
**Rationale**: Aligns with Microsoft 365 security principles and enterprise requirements.

**Security Controls**:
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication required through Azure AD
- **Authorization**: Least privilege access with role-based permissions
- **Data Protection**: SharePoint DLP policies and Azure Information Protection
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging to Azure Sentinel for security monitoring
- **Network Security**: SharePoint tenant isolation and Azure AD Conditional Access

## Compliance and Audit Research

### Decision: Microsoft 365 Compliance Center Integration
**Rationale**: Leverages existing enterprise compliance infrastructure and reduces custom development complexity.

**Compliance Features**:
- **Data Retention**: Microsoft 365 retention policies for announcements
- **Legal Hold**: Compliance center holds for litigation support
- **Audit Logging**: Microsoft 365 audit log integration with custom application events
- **Data Classification**: Azure Information Protection for sensitive announcements

## Development and Testing Strategy

### Decision: Azure DevOps with Automated Testing Pipeline
**Rationale**: Integrates with existing Microsoft toolchain and provides enterprise-grade CI/CD capabilities.

**Testing Approach**:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Microsoft Graph SDK testing with mock services
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for full user workflow testing
- **Compliance Testing**: Automated accessibility and security scanning
- **Performance Testing**: Azure Load Testing for scalability validation

## Deployment Strategy

### Decision: Phased Rollout with Feature Flags
**Rationale**: Minimizes risk while preserving existing functionality during transition.

**Deployment Phases**:
1. **Pilot**: HR team testing with existing functionality + authentication
2. **Beta**: Extended testing with approval workflows enabled
3. **Production**: Full rollout with audit logging and compliance features
4. **Optimization**: Performance tuning and advanced features

**Rollback Plan**:
- Feature flags allow instant disable of new functionality
- SharePoint version history enables data rollback
- Existing React app remains available as fallback
