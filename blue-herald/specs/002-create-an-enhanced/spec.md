**Feature Branch**: `002-create-an-enhanced`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an enhanced version of the Employee Announcement Tool that preserves all existing business logic but incorporates the corporate controls from corporate-controls.md. Specifically: PRESERVE: - Policy Update workflow requiring Policy Name and Effective Date - All communication types (Policy Update, Company News, Team Announcement, Benefits Update) - Dynamic form fields based on communication type - Real-time preview functionality - Tone selection and formatting ADD ENTERPRISE CONTROLS: - Active Directory authentication with role-based access - Management approval workflows for Policy Updates - Complete audit logging for all user actions - Data retention and compliance features - Security controls and testing requirements Generate specifications that show exactly how to transform the prototype into an enterprise-ready application."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Authenticated HR administrators, team managers, and executives need to create, review, approve, and send professional announcements through an enterprise-controlled system. The enhanced tool preserves all existing announcement creation workflows while adding corporate governance including Active Directory authentication, management approval workflows for policy updates, comprehensive audit logging, and data retention compliance.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Preserved Core Functionality
1. **Given** an authenticated HR administrator wants to send a policy update, **When** they select "Policy Update" communication type, **Then** the system displays policy name and effective date fields as required AND initiates approval workflow
2. **Given** a user fills out an announcement form completely, **When** they view the preview section, **Then** the preview shows the exact formatting, tone styling, and content that recipients will see
3. **Given** a user selects "Company News" communication type, **When** the form loads contextual fields, **Then** the system auto-suggests "Friendly" tone AND logs the selection action

#### New Enterprise Controls
4. **Given** an unauthenticated user accesses the application, **When** they attempt to view any content, **Then** they are redirected to Active Directory login
5. **Given** an HR coordinator creates a policy update announcement, **When** they submit for sending, **Then** the system routes to their manager for approval AND logs the submission
6. **Given** a manager receives a policy update for approval, **When** they approve or reject, **Then** the system logs the decision with timestamp and rationale
7. **Given** any user performs any action in the system, **When** the action completes, **Then** the system logs user identity, action type, timestamp, and relevant data to central audit system
8. **Given** an announcement is successfully sent, **When** data retention period expires, **Then** the system archives announcement data according to compliance requirements

#### Role-Based Access Scenarios
9. **Given** a user with "HR Coordinator" role, **When** they access the system, **Then** they can create announcements but cannot send policy updates without approval
10. **Given** a user with "HR Manager" role, **When** they access the system, **Then** they can create and approve policy updates AND review pending approvals
11. **Given** a user with "Executive" role, **When** they access the system, **Then** they can create, approve, and send all communication types without additional approval

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a policy update approval request expires without manager response?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during Active Directory authentication?
- What occurs when audit logging system is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system manage data retention when legal hold requirements conflict with standard retention schedules?
- What happens when a manager who needs to approve a policy update is no longer with the company?
